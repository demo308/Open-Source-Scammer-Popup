# Open Source Scammer Popup (OSSP)
## What's OSSP?
**Open Source Scammer Popup (OSSP)** is a [tech support scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0346-tech-support-scams "tech support scam") popup that's open source. This was created so [scambaiters](https://www.reddit.com/r/scambait/ "scambaiters") can create silly popups whenever scammers ask *"Can I see the popup on your screen?"*

**If you discover someone using this for illegal purposes, contact me and I will do everything I can to raid, annoy them, and get their information out to authorities. If this continues to be used for the incorrect reasons, I will remove this from GitHub entirely.**
## How do I modify it?
### Modifying the background
1. Go to *assets > images*
2. Open *background.png* in any image editor you want. 
3. Modify it. You can even replace it entirely as long as it is the same dimensions!
### Modifying the tab icon (favicon)
1. Search for your icon in Google Search and download it
2. Go [here](https://realfavicongenerator.net/ "here")
3. Upload the file
4. Follow their instructions.

If you can't get their services to work, there are plenty of other websites that can get favicons set up. You can also do it manually, but that's a pain in the neck especially if you don't know HTML.
### Modifying the popup text
1. Open *index.html* in any text editor
2. Edit the content in the script tag to whatever you want. If you know JavaScript, you can even create and use your own scripts!
### Further Modifications
To modify this any further, you will have to at least know [HTML](https://www.codeschool.com/learn/html-css "HTML"). You can do some other cool stuff using [JavaScript](https://www.codeschool.com/learn/javascript "JavaScript").

## How do I host this on the Internet?

**Note:** Although you can host this in a paid host or manually, I recommend you don't due to how basic this project is. 

1. **Find a hosting service**. I recommend [ProFreeHost](https://profreehost.com/) since it's free and functional
2. **Download [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/ "FileZilla") or [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php "WinSCP").** Either one will work. 
3. **Enter the FTP info.** It should be provided by whichever hosting service you're using.
4. **Drag the files into the correct location on the server.** Your hosting service should explain where to upload them.
5. **Now go to your website link and it should work!**
