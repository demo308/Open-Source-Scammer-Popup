# Open Source Scammer Popup (OSSP)
## What is OSSP?
Open Source Scammer Popup (OSSP) is a [tech support scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0346-tech-support-scams "tech support scam") popup that is open source. This was made so [scambaiters](https://www.reddit.com/r/scambait/ "scambaiters") can create silly popups whenever scammers ask *"Can I see the popup on your screen?"*

**If you find someone using this for illegal purposes, please contact me and I will do everything I can to raid, annoy them, and get their information out to authorities. If this continues to be used for incorrect reasons, I will take this off GitHub entirely.
## How do I modify it?
### Modifying the background
1. Go to assets > image
2. Open photo.PNG in any image editor you want
3. Modify it. You can even replace it entirely as long as it is the same dimensions!
### Modifying the tab icon
1. Find your icon in Google Search and download it
2. Go [here](https://realfavicongenerator.net/ "here")
3. Upload the file
4. Follow their instructions

If you can't get their services to work, there are plenty of other websites that can get favicons set up. You can also do it manually, but that's a pain in the neck especially if you don't know HTML.
### Changing the popup text
1. Open index.html in any text editor
2. Edit the content in the script tag to whatever you want. If you know JavaScript, you can even create and use your own scripts!
### Further Modifications
To modify this any further, you will have to at least know [HTML](https://www.codeschool.com/learn/html-css "HTML"). You can do some other cool stuff using [JavaScript](https://www.codeschool.com/learn/javascript "JavaScript").

## How do I put this on the Internet?

1. Find a hosting service (I recommend ProFreeHost since it is free and functional)
2. Download [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/ "FileZilla") or [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php "WinSCP"). Either one will work. 
3. Enter the FTP info. It should be provided by your hosting service
4. Drag the files into the correct location on the server. Your hosting service should explain where to upload them.
5. Now go to your website link and it should work!
