# Open Source Scammer Popup (OSSP)
## What is it?
Open Source Scammer Popup (OSSP) is a tech support scam popup that is open source. **THIS WAS NOT CREATED FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES.** In fact, it is for quite the opposite. This was made so scambaiters can create silly popups whenever scammers ask *"Can I see the popup on your screen?"* 
## How do I modify it?
### Modifying the background
1. Go to assets > image
2. Open photo.jpg in any image editor you want.
3. Modify it. You can even replace it entirely as long as it is the same dimensions!
## Modifying the tab icon
1. Find your icon in Google Search and download it
2. Go [here](https://realfavicongenerator.net/ "here")
3. Upload the file
4. Follow the instructions
### Changing the popup text
1. Open index.html in any text editor
2. Edit the content in the script tag to whatever you want. If you know JavaScript, you can even create and use your own scripts!
### Further Modifications
To modify this any further, you will have to at least know HTML. You can do some other cool stuff using JavaScript.

## How do I put this on the Internet?

1. Find a hosting service (I recommend ProFreeHost since it is free and functional)
2. Download FileZilla or WinSCP. Either one will work. 
3. Enter the FTP information. It should be provided in your hosting service
4. Drag the files into the correct location on the server. Your hosting service should explain where to upload them.
5. Now go to your website link and it should work!
